# Explanations of paths

- [Scenes](https://github.com/alintulu/ForestFondler/tree/master/Game/Assets/Scenes) conatins a
MainScene and two backup duplicates from different stages that I created nervous about not having comitted anything
to git yet
- [MainScene.unity](https://github.com/alintulu/ForestFondler/blob/master/Game/Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity) is the most
up-to-date one and really the only scene you need to care about
- [ShitIWantToDelete](https://github.com/alintulu/ForestFondler/tree/master/Game/Assets/ShitIWantToDelete) contains shit I wanted to delete but was to afraid it was inherited by something so I just piled them into a folder
- [Scripts](https://github.com/alintulu/ForestFondler/tree/master/Game/Assets/Scripts) contains all scripts, some might be a bit unnecessary, again I was too afraid to delete it. However we have three different categories of scripts
	- Moving the hands (most of them)
	- Detecting the colliders
	- Stuff like load scenes

# Things that could be fixed if we feel like it :)

- [ ] Change hand sprite so that hand ends higher up (easiest way to fix awkward hand vrist problem)
- [ ] Flip hand sprite to avoid awkward hand flip problem
- [ ] Jiggly physics (?)
